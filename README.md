Official Nuxt codemods to help users adopt new features and handle breaking changes with ease.

Community contributions are welcome and appreciated! Check open issues for codemods to build, or open a new one if somethingâ€™s missing. See the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Running codemods
> [!CAUTION]
> Codemods modify code! Run them only on Git-tracked files, and commit or stash changes first.

### From the registry
Recommended for the best UX. This downloads the package from the [Registry](https://app.codemod.com/registry).

```bash
npx codemod@latest <codemod-name>
```

For example:

```bash
npx codemod@latest @nodejs/tmpDir-to-tmpdir
```

### From source

```bash
npx codemod workflow run -w /path/to/folder/containing/workflow.yaml
```

> \[!NOTE]
> By default, codemods run in the current folder. Add `-t /target/path` to change it.

See the [Codemod docs](https://go.codemod.com/cli-docs) for all CLI commands and options.
